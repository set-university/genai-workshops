## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**  

1. **Install Conda**  
   If you don't have Conda installed, download and install **Miniconda** (lightweight) or **Anaconda** (full distribution):

   - **Miniconda (recommended):** [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  
   - **Anaconda:** [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

   After installation, verify it works:
   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```

   > **Note (macOS/Linux):** You may need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` / `source ~/.zshrc` after installation for the `conda` command to be available.

2. **Set up a Python environment**  
   Create and activate a Conda environment:  
   ```bash
   conda create -n genai_workshop python=3.10
   conda activate genai_workshop
   ```  

3. **Install dependencies**  
   Make sure `pip` is up-to-date and install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
