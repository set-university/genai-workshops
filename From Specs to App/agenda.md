**Workshop 2: From Specs to App — AI-Assisted Implementation**

**Duration:** 2 hours

Pick up where Workshop 1 left off: take your product specs and turn them into a working application — live. We'll cover solution architecture, breaking requirements into epics and user stories, then build the app story-by-story using AI coding tools. We'll wrap up with validation — automated tests, code review, and a live demo of the finished product.

**What to prepare:**
- Have an AI coding tool installed and authenticated. Claude Code (VS Code extension) is preferred; Cursor and Windsurf also work.
- Complete your capstone brainstorming homework from Workshop 1

**What to bring:**
- Your laptop with the setup completed
- Your product brief and PRD from Workshop 1 (or the homework brainstorming output)

**What you'll walk away with:**
- Understanding of the full specs-to-code workflow using AI coding tools
- A working demo app built live from specs in under 2 hours
- Confidence to independently build your capstone project using the same process
