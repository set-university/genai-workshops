**Workshop 1: From Idea to Specs — AI-Assisted Product Definition**

**Duration:** 2 hours

Learn how to use BMAD tools to go from a raw idea to implementation-ready product specifications. We'll walk through brainstorming, design thinking, market research, product brief, and PRD — all powered by AI agents.

By the end of this session, you'll have a clear direction for your capstone project — we'll use AI-powered brainstorming to generate ideas tailored to your background and interests, then guide you through selecting the one that best fits the course constraints and your personal goals.

**What to prepare:**
- Have an AI coding tool installed and authenticated. Claude Code (VS Code extension) is preferred; Cursor and Windsurf also work.

**What to bring:**
- Your laptop with the setup completed
- A few sentences about yourself: your role, hobbies, daily frustrations, and any product ideas you've been thinking about — this is the raw material for finding your capstone topic

**What you'll walk away with:**
- A capstone project topic selected (or strong candidates to choose from)
- A complete product specification package (user personas, market analysis, product brief, PRD)
- The ability to run the same process independently for your own project
